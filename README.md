# Mask_RCNN-
Here in this project we did image segmentatio

So what is Mask RCNN,
    Its faster RCNN with a mask. Faster RCNN is an object detection algorithm very similar to YOLO.  Its giving us bounding boxes, labels and scores. But here in Mask RCNN we are also adding mask. We are able to label all the pixels that belong to each object with a mask.
